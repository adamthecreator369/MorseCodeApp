# Morse Coder App
<b>Objective</b><br>
The objective of the project was to build a “Morse Code tree” using character and Morse Code pairs stored in a data file, and then use the tree to encode and decode user messages.<br>

<b>Our Team</b><br>
Our team consists of two Java developers: 
*	Adam Jost
*	Neha Metlapalli<br>


<b>System Overview</b><br>
A two-in-one, GUI based application consisting of a Morse Code chat application and a Morse Code encoding and decoding tool. Both items can be used independently or simultaneously. When used together a user can send and receive Morse Code messages in the Morse Code chat application and then use the decoding tool to decode and read the received messages.<br> 

<b>The Interface</b><br>
The graphical user interface (GUI) for this application was built using Swing components. The CrossPlatformLookAndFeel class has been used to ensure that the GUI’s components will look and behave the same across all platforms.<br>
